      I really enjoyed taking CS20 several semesters ago and would love to learn
      more about how to create beautiful and elegant websites.

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://tai-er.org/">Tai Er</a> is my favourite restaurant. They
      are a Chinese restaurant franchise specializing in food from the Sichuan
      region. The hallmark of Sichuan cuisine is the spice, and they have the
      most delicious pickled cabbage and fish dishes.

          I love eating carrot cake so much that I have a carrot cake journal
          where I review all the different carrot cakes I have eaten around the
          world. After traveling and reviewing the cakes from many different
          countries, including Dubai, France, Canada, and China, I have
          concluded that the best way to make carrot cake is with lots of
          carrots and a fresh cream cheese frosting, nuts optional.
